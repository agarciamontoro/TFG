The Kerr spacetime is a fundamental topic in General Relativity and astrophysics since it is known that almost every collapsing object will behave as the Kerr black hole for long times. The motion of test particles in this spacetime is crucial in astrophysics because describes the motion around objects such as planets, stars, planetary
systems, and even black holes. Using the solution to the motion of test parti-
cles we can explain many purely relativistic effects such as the precession of
the perihelion of Mercury and the deflection of light rays as they pass close to
a massive object. Thus, the motion of test particles in static space-times with
spherical symmetry conforms not only a way to understand more thoroughly
relativistic phenomena but also determines important information for the de-
tection and prediction of relevant astrophysical objects. Among these objects
we have the black holes, which are purely relativistic entities able to distort
the spacetime around them so strongly that not even light can escape their
attraction when they aproach close enough. Therefore, the understanding and
the study of motion around these objects helps us to understand their na-
ture in more detail. Solutions to the motion of particles in what is termed
”the exterior part” of the metric are widely known and have been studied in
numerous textbooks. However, these external solutions are incomplete if the
object under consideration is a black hole. One objective of this work is to
find a method that describes the full motion of the particles in the region of
interest for black holes in static spherically symmetric space-times. As we will
see, these are difficulties describing the motion across the horizons and we
must find tools that allow us to solve them. Our main focus will be the use of
dynamical systems, which have proven to be a powerful tool in the study and
description of physical systems, as demonstrated by theoretical mechanics. As
we are interested in describing the full motion of the particles, including the
vicinity of the singularity, we use a technique of dynamical systems known as
the ” blow up” of the collision. This process consists in performing geometric
modifications to the dynamical system that allows us to eliminate all the dif-
ficulties associated to the fact that we are dealing with a non-regular point.
To do this, we use a regularization process known as McGehee coordinates,
which have been used by several mathematicians and physicists previously to
regularize some simple potentials. As we are interested in describing all sp-
herical spacetimes, we study in depth the process of regularization in order
to understand what is the best approach for our problem as well as for a va-
riety of other similar problems.
