\section{Differentiable manifolds}

Roughly speaking, a manifold is a topological space that, locally, looks like the Euclidean space $\Real^n$. This similitude is essential, and will let us control the manifold as if we were working in the Euclidean space; generally, its properties will be proved using the known properties of $\Real^n$.

The following definition specifies the formal concept of a topological manifold:

\begin{definition}[N-dimensional topological manifold]
    Let $M^n$ be an $n$-dimensional topological space. The space $M^n$ is called a topological manifold if the following properties are satisfied:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $M^n$ is locally homeomorphic to $\Real^n$. \label{def:manifold:homeo}
        \item $M^n$ is a Hausdorff space. \label{def:manifold:haussdorf}
        \item $M^n$ has a countable topological basis. \label{def:manifold:basis}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

The first property states that, for every point $p \in M^n$, there exists an open neighbourhood $U \subset M^n$ of $p$ and a homeomorphism
\[
    h \colon U \to V
\]

with $V \subset \Real^n$ an open set.

The Hausdorff property has to be added, as the local homeomorphism does not imply this topological characteristic. The usual counterexample is the line with two origins: let $M = \Real \cup p$ be the union of the real line and a point $p \notin \Real$. Define a topology in this space with $\Real \subset M$ as an open set and the neighbourhoods of $p$ being the sets $(U \setminus \{0\}) \cup \{p\}$, where $U$ is a neighbourhood of $0 \in \Real$. This space is locally Euclidean but not Hausdorff: the intersection of any two neighbourhoods of the points $0 \in \Real$ and $p$ is non-empty.

%TODO:0 Add a figure with the two-origins line

The last property will prove to be key in our study, as it will let us define metrics on the manifold.

\subsection{Charts}

%TODO: Add a motivation to the concept of chart (basically, that we need to come down to an Euclidean space; we cannot do much in the ideal world of the manifolds)

\begin{definition}[Coordinate chart]
    A \emph{coordinate chart} ---or \emph{coordinate system}--- in a topological manifold $M^n$ is a homeomorphism $h \colon U \to V$ from an open subset of the manifold $U \subset M$ onto an open subset of the Euclidean space $V \subset \Real^n$.

    We call $U$ a \emph{coordinate neighbourhood} in $M$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Coordinate atlas]
    Let
    \[
    A = \{h_\alpha \colon U_\alpha \to V_\alpha / \alpha \in I\}
    \]
    be a set of coordinate charts in a topological manifold $M^n$, where $I$ is a family of indices and the open subsets $U_\alpha \subset M$ are the corresponding coordinate neighbourhoods.

    $A$ is said to be an \emph{atlas} of M if every point is covered with a coordinate neighbourhood; i.e., if $\cup_{\alpha \in I} U_\alpha = M$.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Differentiable structures}

\begin{definition}[Transition map]
    Let $M^n$ be a manifold and $(U, \phi)$, $(V, \psi)$ a pair of coordinate charts in $M^n$ with overlapping domains
    \[
        U \cap V \neq \emptyset
    \]

    The homeomorphism between the open sets of the Euclidean space $\Real^n$
    \[
        \psi \circ \phi^{-1} \colon \phi(U \cap V) \to \psi(U \cap V)
    \]
    is called a \emph{transition map}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Smooth overlap]
    Two charts $(U, \phi)$, $(V, \psi)$ are said to overlap smoothly if their domains are disjoint ---i.e., if $U \cap V  = \emptyset$--- or if the transition map $\psi \circ \phi^{-1}$ is a diffeomorphism.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Smooth coordinate atlas]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Maximal atlas]
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Maximal atlas uniqueness]
\end{proposition}
