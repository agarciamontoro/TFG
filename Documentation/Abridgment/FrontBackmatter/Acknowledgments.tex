\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

Many thanks to my supervisors Pablo and Alfonso, whose patience seems to be infinite.

Thanks to everybody that supported this work in one way or another: to my family, to my friends and to Eva; specially to her.

Special thanks to the free software community in general, and to the \emph{StackExchange} community in particular. They are always there to help beginners become experts.

Thank you.
