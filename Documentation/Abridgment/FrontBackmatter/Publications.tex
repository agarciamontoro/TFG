\chapter*{Publications}\graffito{This is just an early --~and currently ugly~-- test!}
This might come in handy for PhD theses: some ideas and figures have appeared previously in the following publications:

%\noindent Put your publications from the thesis here. The packages \texttt{multibib} or \texttt{bibtopic} etc. can be used to handle multiple different bibliographies in your document.

\begin{refsection}[ownpubs]
    \small
    \nocite{*} % is local to to the enclosing refsection
    \printbibliography[heading=none]
\end{refsection}

\emph{Attention}: This requires a separate run of \texttt{bibtex} for your \texttt{refsection}, \eg, \texttt{ClassicThesis1-blx} for this file. You might also use \texttt{biber} as the backend for \texttt{biblatex}. See also \url{http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/128196/problem-with-refsection}.
