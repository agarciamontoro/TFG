# General Relativity Raytracer
## A Massively Parallel Free Software Alternative.

This repository contains all the work for my Bachelor's thesis: a ray tracer that computes the trajectories of photons in relativistic spacetimes; in particular around a Kerr black hole, along with the final thesis.

The package can be found on the [Raytracer](https://github.com/agarciamontoro/TFG/tree/master/Software/Raytracer) directory; the sources for the thesis are stored on the [Report](https://github.com/agarciamontoro/TFG/tree/master/Documentation/Report) directory.

### What can I do with this?

This ray tracer can render images of what an observer near a Kerr black hole would see, from arbitrary positions and with arbitrary textures mapped on the bodies.

</p>

You can even visualize the geodesics around the black hole in 3D!
