# General Relativity Raytracer
## A Massively Parallel Free Software Alternative.

This repository contains the work on a ray tracer that computes the trajectories of photons in relativistic spacetimes; in particular around a Kerr black hole.

The final package can be found on the [Raytracer](https://github.com/agarciamontoro/TFG/tree/master/Software/Raytracer) directory.

--------

It can render images of what an observer near a Kerr black hole would see, from arbitrary positions and with arbitrary textures mapped on the bodies.

</p>

You can even visualize the geodesics around the black hole in 3D!
