The Kerr spacetime is a fundamental topic in General Relativity and astrophysics since it is known that almost every collapsing object will behave as the Kerr black hole. The motion of test particles in this spacetime is crucial in astrophysics because a lot of interesting astrophysical objects are black holes. In this work we present a method that makes particularly easy to understand the characteristics of the motion of particles is some important regions of the Kerr spacetime. Concretely, we will analyze the geodesic flow by reducing widely the problem to a simple two-dimensional phase portrait, valid even in regions beyond the event horizon. In addition, we will study some of the most popular features of Kerr black holes by direct representation of the geodesics obtained by numerical integration.
